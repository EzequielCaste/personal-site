# Hello World!

![Welcome!](https://y.yarn.co/9ad103b2-da58-41dd-9270-e59ad61dba2e_screenshot.jpg)

> Hello, good evening and welcome to The Middle of the Blog.

Actually, this is the beginning of my blog, the very first post ever! Having said that, Welcome!

## About me

Hi there! My name is Ezequiel Castellanos and I'm a junior Front-end web developer and English/Spanish translator.

I enjoy making websites, drinking [mate](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_(drink)>), baking homemade pizza and bread, and also researching and learning about technology or science. When I'm not coding,

I started creating websites as a hobby and now I've realized this can be more than a hobby. So I started to teach myself **HTML, CSS and JavaScript**, thanks to the great developer community at freeCodeCamp. Currently learning more in depth **React.js**, **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS** and **SASS**.

## The Blog

This blog is a nice little fun project I'm building with the help of [Manuel Obregozo](https://www.manuelobregozo.com/). He's been helping me on my developer path with great advice and encouraging me to apply to as many jobs as possible. **First Dev Job here I come!** ðŸš€

The main idea of this site is to have a working blog and add updates and features in small increments. For a start, the blog is developed with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. I will try to detail all the challenges and obstacles that appear during the development of this blog. Stay tuned! ðŸ‘‹
