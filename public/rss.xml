<p>Actually, this is the beginning of my blog, the very first post ever! Having said that, Welcome!</p>
<h2>About me</h2>
<p>Hi there! My name is Ezequiel Castellanos and I'm a junior Front-end web developer and English/Spanish translator.</p>
<p>I enjoy making websites, drinking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_(drink)">mate</a>, baking homemade pizza and bread, and also researching and learning about technology or science. When I'm not coding,</p>
<p>I started creating websites as a hobby and now I've realized this can be more than a hobby. So I started to teach myself <strong>HTML, CSS and JavaScript</strong>, thanks to the great developer community at freeCodeCamp. Currently learning more in depth <strong>React.js</strong>, <strong>Next.js</strong>, <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong> and <strong>SASS</strong>.</p>
<h2>The Blog</h2>
<p>This blog is a nice little fun project I'm building with the help of <a href="https://www.manuelobregozo.com/">Manuel Obregozo</a>. He's been helping me on my developer path with great advice and encouraging me to apply to as many jobs as possible. <strong>First Dev Job here I come!</strong> ðŸš€</p>
<p>The main idea of this site is to have a working blog and add updates and features in small increments. For a start, the blog is developed with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. I will try to detail all the challenges and obstacles that appear during the development of this blog. Stay tuned! ðŸ‘‹</p>]]></content:encoded>
